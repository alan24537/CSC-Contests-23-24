# Problem 5: Catnip Feeding

**Time Limit:** 1s

While talking to your other cat friends, you hear about this *cat drug* called catnip. You decide to try it out and buy $N$ pieces of catnip, each of which has a strength $S_i$. Since you don't want your cat to become desensitized to catnip, you decide to only feed your cat the piece of catnip that has the second strongest strength. However, Jacob doesn't want to go through the trouble of finding the piece of catnip that has the second strongest strength, so he asks you to write a program to do it for him.

## Constraints

$2 \leq N \leq 10^5$
$1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9$

## Input Specification

The first line will contain the integer $N$. The next $N$ lines will contain the strengths $S_i$.

## Output Specification

Output the piece of catnip that has the second strongest strength or `-1` if there is no piece of catnip that has the second strongest strength.
